Features:
- Started as generic armbian 4.19 "linux-source-4.19" package
- Patched for DVD-ROM Mass Storage Support
- Kernel updated from 4.19.28 to 4.19.30
- DTB decompiled and 1.1GHz Overclock applied: arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i-a13-dreamcatcher.dts
- New defconfig: dreamcatcher3_zefie_defconfig  (arch/arm/configs/dreamcatcher3_zefie_defconfig)
- ads7846_device re-injected (todo: dts proper)
- tinydrm enabled (unusable until ili9341 spi lcd done in dts proper)


Known Issues:
- Only tested with make-kpkg (kernel-package from Debian stretch-backports)
  (use ./scripts/zefkpkg.sh)
- DTS isn't actually compiled (you can manually compile it with:
  dtc -I dts -O dtb -o sun5i-a13-dreamcatcher.dtb sun5i-a13-dreamcatcher.dts
- Do not uninstall "linux-dtb-next-sunxi" package, as it has the dtbs
- Kernel does not update automatically, you must manually point the
  /boot/zImage and /boot/uInitrd symlinks to the new files
